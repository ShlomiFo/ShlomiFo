# <p align="center"> Hi, I‚Äôm Shlomi üòä <P>
 
I'm a Junior Full Stack Web Developer with a **strong focus on front-end development and design**

I graduated from Le Wagon Netherlands On March 2024

As a truly millennial, I like to see how web applications can make small and big changes in people lives. Help people to connect, personal growth, build communities, contribute to education, to environment development, health technologies, and create easy access to knowledge and art.


In addition to my technical background, I bring valuable experience from my previous roles as a Head baker & Team manager. This experience has equipped me with exceptional communication, problem-solving, and time management skills.

Yes, I bring cakes and pastries to the office üç∞, and I might even reveal their recipes üìú.

**HobbyBuddy**


Are you new to the city and want to make new friends ?

Are you looking for a buddy to improve some skills ? 

HobbyBuddy is an app that helps people to connect, sharing the same interests. We collaborated in team of four during our coding bootcamp to bring  this app alive, because we believe the best to connect with each other is by actively doing things together, like earning languages, cook, bake, planning your dreamy nails-polish party, find a buddy to gym, jamming, photowalks and so much more‚Ä¶  | Cell 2   |
