- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Shlomi
- ðŸ‘€
I'm a Junior Full Stack Web Developer with a strong focus on front-end development and design. I enjoy the most working with JaveScript, especially React and Vue.js.

On March 2024  I graduated from Le Wagon Netherlands.

As a truly millennial, I like to see how web applications can make small and big changes in people lives. Help people to connect, personal growth, build communities, contribute to education, to environment development, health technologies, and create easy access to knowledge and art.

In addition to my technical background, I bring valuable experience from my previous roles as a Head baker & Team manger. This experience has equipped me with exceptional communication, problem-solving, and time management skills.
